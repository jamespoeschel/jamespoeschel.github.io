The purpose of this project was to identify and map all the traffic equipment in Clearwater as well as all the signal fiber gaps where it is needed to pull new fiber lines in existing or proposed conduit. 

This map shows all the existing and future traffic equipment in the city of Clearwater, Florida. Devices are stacked at locations where there are several devices at the same location.
Two inset maps show a zoomed in view of the Beach and Downtown areas. 
The city of clearwater boundary has a slight spotlight effect that was achieved by tweaking the symbology of the polygon as well as darking the background using a transparent clipped global background feature.

- Regular communication with the municipal client was achieved as well as collaboration with the city's GIS team.
- Additional maps of Fiber gaps, existing conduit sizes, and individual traffic device maps were created to assist engineers in planning
