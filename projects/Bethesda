The Bethesda Bus Frequency Map was a part of a project for Montgomery County, Maryland. The client requested a series of maps within this study area including ones that include parking restrictions, bike and pedestrian infrastructure, traffic signals and intersections, etc. The aim of this map was to show how many WMATA and Ride-On buses per hour pass by each segment of road within the study area. GTFS headway data was collected online and processed.
